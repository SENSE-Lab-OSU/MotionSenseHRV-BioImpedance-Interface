# MotionSenseHRV3-AD5940-Integration


Welcome to the MotionSenseHRV3 Bluetooth Data Collection Repository! This Repo contains both projects for Zephr-based Data Collection (in multiple formats) for both MotionSense 2 and 3, as well as a python based data collection gui application.

# Getting Started

To get started, either clone this repository or download it as a zip file (located at the top right of github). After extracting, you can run the collection application by following the guidelines specified in BluetoothReciever/ReadMe.md. Note that you will need a MotionSense application that is charged and turned on in order for collection to begin.
